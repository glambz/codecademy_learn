# Find Your Hat project from codecademy backend path

## when the program started, the program will ask user for map length, map height, and hole %

## the program will generate the map, and then user start to play the game to find his lost hat

## note that when the character is moved beyond the boundary of the map, the character will warp to the other side of the map instead of dying.
